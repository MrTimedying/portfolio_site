<h1>.p-project: what is it?</h1>

The .p-project is an educational and informative initiative aimed at distributing unbiased and correct knowledge about statistics and its applications in academic settings for research. It is now well known and widespread that academic research, in some fields more than others, is lacking basic knowledge of statistical instruments or the correct interpretation of results.
Researchers nowadays are overtrained on design features, and lack a basic comprehension of what this design is going to affect and where one’s decision could be read and debugged in the aftermath of a data analysis process.
Another reason it’s the incredible and fast spread of noxious information, which is polluting the environment, especially online, of good and reliable information. Even though on most websites, the basic foundations of a test are a well ordered series of “copy and paste” without a critical comment attached to them, there is often a little slimy incorrect information laying around somewhere in these blogs, websites, posts and so on.
<br>
With the .p-project and for these reasons, I’m aiming to spread some of my critical insights and knowledge on a few fundamental aspects of both theory and practice of data analysis and research. 
<br>
The name of the initiative comes from the almighty p-value, that in the last 70 years has transcended its mere mathematical boundaries into a nigh omnipotent mind controlling God. Veteran scientists DO NOT know what a p-value is, how to interpret it, and what kind of conclusions draw from it’s existence after their automatized series of clicks on the statistical software has given it birth.
Most of them comprehend factors that might influence their measurements, but have absolutely no clue as to how that bends data analysis results.
